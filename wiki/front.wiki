 This implementation uses C++ vector objects to accept input, store and output data. This is done to overcome certain programming limitations associated with using arrays. Dynamic arrays were also an option but they require a lot of house-cleaning without having any advantages over vector objects. To learn more about vectors, please refer to excellent tutorial at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/ Vectors and Arrays can be converted back and forth so even if you are more comfortable with arrays, using vectors should not really be a problem.
