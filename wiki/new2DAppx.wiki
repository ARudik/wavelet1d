_Note_

1. dwt_2d and dwt_2d_sym functions are interchangeable in the following code as they take the same arguments. You may have to make some trivial modifications due to different sized output coeffficients.

2. Please make sure that right header file is included. Following sample program links to wavelet2s.h which is the header for static libraries. wavelet2d.h must be included for shared libraries. 

3. I'm using OPENCV to handle images as i already use OPENCV for other image processing work. You may want to use some simpler image libraries as OPENCV is a full image processing suite and is very bulky or you can just use 2D matrices/build your own image classes. Regardless, DWT/IDWT operations are more important than the choice of libraries.
